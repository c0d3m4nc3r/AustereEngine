**This project is no longer maintained as its code does not reflect my current standards for clean, efficient C++ development. I underwent a radical shift in my coding philosophy starting in September 2025. I leave Austere Engine here only as a reference point to track my rapid professional growth.**

# Austere Engine

**Austere Engine** is a minimal, open-source 3D game engine written in modern C++.
It’s designed for simplicity, performance, and full control through code — no visual editor, no drag-and-drop, just clean C++.

> ⚠️ This engine is still in early prototype stage. Expect bugs, unfinished features, and rapid changes.

## 🙋 About

**Austere Engine** is a personal hobby project built for experience, learning, and portfolio purposes.
It is not meant to compete with Unity, Unreal, or Godot — it’s a lightweight foundation for developers who prefer working in code and want full control over their engine.

Use it, break it, fork it, or contribute — it's up to you.
